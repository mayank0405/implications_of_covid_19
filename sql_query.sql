*Implications of COVID - 19
*Case study by Mayank Singh mayanksingholive@gmail.com

For this project you play the role of a data analyst at a research hospital. 
It's the year 2020 and has been unlike anything mankind has ever seen in the last hundred years. 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious viral illness caused by severe acute respiratory 
syndrome SARS-CoV-2. First detected in Wuhan China, it has had a devastating effect on the worldâ€™s demographics resulting in more than 
5.3 million deaths worldwide. It has emerged as the most consequential global health crisis since 
the era of the influenza pandemic of 1918.

We have data from January 2020 to July 2020. We have three tables and using them we will try to analyse the impact
of this pathogen in terms of number of cases, deaths and recoveries.

Let's do it!
