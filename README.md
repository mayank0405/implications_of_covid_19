## Problem Statement
This project is the first of many that will come in my data science journey. For starting, I have done a project on COVID - 19 and tried to do an analysis as to what all has happened during January 2020 to July 2020 worldwide.

It would be helpful to know...

- How many confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries have been.
- What is the percentage increase in certain areas?
- Countries by WHO_Region who have high cases. 

## Datasets used
The datset contains only three tables named:-
- country_wise_latest
- day_wise
- full_grouped

The link for the dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imdevskp/corona-virus-report/data).
