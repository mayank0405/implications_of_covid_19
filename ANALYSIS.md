# Analysis of COVID-19 in 2020
## Context 

-   <font size = "3">A new coronavirus designated 2019-nCoV was first identified in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province</font>
-  <font size = "3"> People developed pneumonia without a clear cause and for which existing vaccines or treatments were not effective.</font>
-   <font size = "3">The virus has shown evidence of human-to-human transmission</font>
-   <font size = "3">Transmission rate (rate of infection) appeared to escalate in mid-January 2020</font>
-   <font size = "3">We have only used SQL for this project and on **Google BigQuery** platform.</font>

## Content

-   <font size = "3">**full_grouped.csv** - Day to day country wise no. of cases (Has County/State/Province level data)</font>
-  <font size = "3"> **country_wise_latest.csv** - Latest country level no. of cases</font>
-  <font size = "3"> **day_wise.csv** - Day wise no. of cases (Doesn't have country level data)</font>

### Exploratory Analysis

#### How many tables are present in the database? 
````sql 
select  table_catalog, table_schema, table_name
from  `sql-projects-403804.sql_project.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLES`
````
**_Results_**
| table_catalog       | table_schema | table_name          |

| sql-projects-403804 | sql_project  | day_wise            |
| sql-projects-403804 | sql_project  | full_grouped        |

❗ **Insight -**  <font size = "3">The above table shows us the tables present in the dataset _sql_project_. There are three tables in the database:- _country_wise_latest_ , _day_wise_ and _full_grouped_.
